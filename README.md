## WHAT Is Tecelan

Tecelan (Portuguese for Weaver) is a Command-Line Program that manipulates strings, be it by identifying the most used words, sorting them alphabetically or decoding/encoding them into other encodings.

## HOW To Use Tecelan

To Open the program, go to `Tecelan/bin/Debug/net6.0` and click on CalcMachine.exe

The program guides you with descriptive text splashes since I want it to be usable even by a child, from the get-go. Future versions will have detailed text splashes
for exceptions and better interface support.

By being a C# 10 Program, it requires the .NET Frameork 6 to run, download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).
